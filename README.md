# legal-databases

This repository offers supplementary material for the paper _Is Every Law for Everyone? Assessing Access to National Legislation through Official Legal Databases around the World_ (yet to be published). See the paper for a detailed outline of the methods.

The main document in this repository is `official-legal-databases.xlsx`. It contains the URLs to the official legal databases (OLDs) of 204 countries and jurisdictions, including the coding results.

The file `figures-and-tables.R` contains the R codes for generating the graphs and tables as well as the statistical significance tests.
